# TDS - Project I

* I created a Python script to scrape GitHub user data utilizing the GitHub API. The script searches for users located in Toronto with a minimum of 100 followers. It retrieves detailed information, including names, companies, and repositories. The data is processed and saved in two CSV files: users.csv and repositories.csv
* The most interesting and surprising fact I found after analyzing the the data is JavaScript which is used in more than 10000 repos (from 1200 repos in 2018 to just 200 repos in 2024), JavaScript is not preferred by many developers these days. On top of that TypeScript is becoming popular along with python.
* A Signinficant growth in emerging languages like Haxe,Starlark,BQN,Mustache,OpenEdge ABL has been observed. Hence developers in Toronto are recommended to upskill themselves in these languages.
